# Hand-Written_Image_Generation_with_Simple_GAN


# Goal
In this notebook, you're going to create your first generative adversarial network (GAN) for this course! Specifically, you will build and train a GAN that can generate hand-written images of digits (0-9). You will be using PyTorch in this specialization, so if you're not familiar with this framework, you may find the PyTorch documentation useful. The hints will also often include links to relevant documentation.

# Learning Objectives
Build the generator and discriminator components of a GAN from scratch.
Create generator and discriminator loss functions.
Train your GAN and visualize the generated images.
